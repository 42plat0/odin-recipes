        </ul>
       <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the pickled red onions: In a small pot, combine the water, apple cider vinegar, salt, sugar, peppercorns, and coriander seeds, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat and add the sliced onion, making sure they are fully submerged. Let cool to room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Make the Thousand Island Dressing: In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, garlic, and vinegar.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, season the ground beef generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix until evenly combined.</li>
                <li>Divide the beef into 4 8-ounce portions and form into patties. Place on a cutting board. Use your thumb to press a divot into the center of each burger.</li>
                <li>Heat the grapeseed oil in a cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Add the burger patties and cook for 3-4 minutes, without disturbing, until browned.</li>
                <li>Use a spatula to flip the burgers over and place a slice of cheddar on each one. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, until the burgers are cooked through and cheese has melted.</li>
                <li>Place on sesame buns and top with the pickled red onions, Thousand Island Dressing, tomato, and lettuce. Serve with French fries.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
